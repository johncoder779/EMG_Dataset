EMG Signal Dataset



Ten male/female (5+5) subjects participated in this study (mean age 30 ± 2.2 years, weight 73 ± 9.94 kg, and BMI 23.98 ± 2.63).



Surface EMG signals recorded from
eight muscles included the: (1) bicep femoris (BF); (2) vastus lateralis (VL); (3) anterior deltoid (AD),
(4) rectus femoris (RF); (5) middle deltoid (MD); (6) upper trapezius (UT); (7) gastrocnemius medialis
(GS); and (8) supraspinatus (SP)

An eight channel EMG system (ME6000 Bittium Bio signals, Mega electronics, Kuopio Finland
Ltd.; Model ME6000, Kuopio, Finland) was used to acquire EMG signals with a sampling rate of
1024 Hz


EMG signals were recorded for a longer duration from each subject. 
These signals were segmented to form a signal/observation of duration 10 seconds.
EMG data is divided into two folders, i.e., Fatigue, and Non Fatigue Folder. Fatigue folder contains
